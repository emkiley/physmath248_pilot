    "(1) Consider the cubic polynomial $z^3-1$.  The roots are $1, e^{2 \\pi i/3}$ and $e^{-2 \\pi i /3}$. Write a python function that takes as input four floting point numbers $x_0, x_1, y_0, y_1$ and an integer $n$, and plots (on the screen) which root Newton's method converges to, when one uses an initial guess in a grid of point in the rectangle $[x_0, x_1] \\times [y_0, y_1]$, using resolution $n$ for the grid.  Use colours to indicate which root Newton's method finds.  Include a plot for the rectangle $[-2,2] \\times [-2,2]$ with $n=400$.  I have included a symbolic version of Newton's method that allows you to use complex numbers as input, it is a slight modification of the algorithm from the second week."

    "(2) In class we have seen implementations of the mid-point rule and Simpson's 3/8-method to approximate integrals. One of the key features of these methods (especially useful when your function comes from measured data) is that the technique uses as its input **only** the values of $f(x)$ at a finite number of points.  Sometimes one has access to **more** information about $f$ than simply its values.  In this problem, we ask you to write a script to approximate integrals numerically, but where one has a **symbolic** expression for $f$, and therefore using sympy, one also has access to $f'$. \n",
