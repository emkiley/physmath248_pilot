    "## Root finding: Newton-Raphson method\n",
    "\n",
    "**Literature: ** Numerical Recipes, Chapter 9.0 and 9.4 \n",
    "\n",
    "Root-finding is required in many applications of computational physics. It is at the core of the fundamental task to solve an equation numerically. Any equation with a right-hand and left-hand side can be rearranged to \n",
    "$$ f(x) = 0.$$\n",
    "If the there is only one independent variable we have just a one-dimensional problem. The Newton-Raphson method is a robust and easy method to find the root of a function. It has very fast convergence if there is a good initial guess, but it has - like other methods - several pathologies that one needs to be aware off. One of its advantages is that it does generalize to multiple dimensions in a straight-forward way. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical idea of the method\n",
    "\n",
    "The method starts with a good initial guess $x_{ini}$ of the root. Evaluating the function and the derivative for the initial guess provides a correction $\\delta$ toward the actual root $x'$."

    "- higher-order terms are important, and initial guess is not good enough $\\rightarrow$ the method will send you off to infinity\n",
    "- non-convergent cycles: there could be a case, for example, when table look-up is involved in calculating the derivative, that correction are bouncing the guess from \n",
    "one side of the root to the other indefinitely without ever coming closer\n",
    "- there could be multiple roots, and the one the NR method is finding is only a local root selected by the choice of initial guess.\n",

    "Note that all methods have pathologies, or in other words, have their\n",
