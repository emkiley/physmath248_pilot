    "My initial impression is VTK, Mayavi and Python SciTools have the most pleasant and flexible rendering engine.  All three use the VTK library.  The VTK library has good documentation on-line but it is something of a *power user* visualization toolkit, where one might have to write a significant amount of code to get your displays *just right*.  The other libraries strive more for convenience, rather than flexibility and precision.  In my initial explorations I've found Mayavi the best compromise between ease-of-use and informative graphics. \n"
