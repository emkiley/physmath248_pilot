    "#### The Lorenz equations\n",

    "(This is exercise 8.3 in Newman, _Computational Physics_)\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most celebrated sets of differential equations in physics is the [Lorenz equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenz_system):\n",
    "$$ \\frac{dx}{dt} = \\sigma(y-x) $$ $$\\frac{dy}{dt} = rx -y -xz$$ $$\\frac{dz}{dt} = xy - bz$$ where $\\sigma$, $r$ and $b$ are constants. (The names of these constants may seem arbirtrary and odd but are always used in these equations -- _for historical reasons_.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read about these equations, when and why they were introduced? What special behaviour do they show?\n",
    "2. Write a program to solve the Lorenz equations for the case $\\sigma = 10$, $r=10$, and $b = \\frac{8}{3}$ in the range from $t = 0$ to $t = 50 $ with the intial condition $(x,y,z) = (0,1,0)$. Have your program make a plot of $y$ as a function of time. Note the unpredictable nature of the motion. \n",
    "3. Modify your program to produce a plot of $z$ agains $x$. You should see a picture of the famous _strange attractor_ of the Lorenz equations, a lop-sided butterfly-shaped plot that never repeats itself.\n",
    "4. How can you animate your solution? Sudy the [matplotlib animation examples](http://matplotlib.org/examples/animation/index.html) to get some ideas.\n",
