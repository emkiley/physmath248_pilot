    " - Plots of weekly averages.\n",
    " - Plots for only Fridays and Saturdays. \n",
    "* Once you have found some deviations from the norm, look for possible explanations:\n",
    " - Heat maps (i.e. spatial patterns).  These could help you locate (spatially) where the deviations occur, once you know they exist. \n",
    " - Outside information: Do they occur during warm weather?  Holidays?  If your number of 'big' deviations is small you could check these by hand.  But if they appear large, you could download a record of daily temperatures from [Weather Canada](http://climate.weather.gc.ca/advanceSearch/searchHistoricDataStations_e.html?timeframe=1&Prov=BC&StationID=6812&hlyRange=1994-02-01%7C2016-03-13&Year=2016&Month=3&Day=13&searchType=stnProx&txtRadius=25&optProxType=navLink&txtLatDecDeg=48.457&txtLongDecDeg=123.30461111111&optLimit=specDate&selRowPerPage=25&station=VICTORIA+UNIVERSITY+CS). Max daily temperatures can be readily stripped from the csv download. \n",
